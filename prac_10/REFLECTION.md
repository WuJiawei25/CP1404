# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

...My estimate accuracy was mixed at first—some tasks took longer than expected due to unexpected debugging or figuring out unfamiliar concepts, while others were quicker than I thought.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

...Over time, I became better at breaking down tasks and recognizing which parts would be time-consuming. I also got better at accounting for testing and debugging time in my estimates.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

...I learned how to assess the complexity of tasks more accurately and manage my time better. Estimating also made me more mindful of how I work and where I tend to underestimate effort.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

...Being reviewed helped me notice issues I had overlooked and taught me alternative, often cleaner, ways to write code. It reminded me of the importance of readability and good variable naming.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

...Reviewing others' code helped me spot common mistakes and improve my own style. It also deepened my understanding of good coding practices and showed me different approaches to solving the same problem.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/Sin-98/CP1404practicals/pull/6]()

### Explanation

...In this review, I provided specific suggestions on naming conventions and improving readability. I also pointed out where comments or docstrings could help clarify the purpose of functions.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/Sithu223/cp1404practicals/pull/5]()

### Explanation

...This review included constructive feedback on consistency in code formatting, logic flow improvements, and encouraging the use of constants instead of magic numbers. I also acknowledged what was done well to keep the feedback balanced.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

...I would include a few short videos or diagrams explaining how the tasks relate to real-world programming scenarios. It would also help to have more peer code review opportunities built into each week’s prac.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

...I consistently wrote clean and well-structured code, followed the task instructions carefully, and made sure to test and validate my programs. I also stayed on top of the weekly work and participated actively in code reviews.
