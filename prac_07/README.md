# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## About This Repository
This repository contains the practical exercises and projects I made for the CP1404 course. It serves as a place for me to practice programming concepts, improve my programming skills, and complete assignments related to software development.

## About Me
Hello! I am Wu Jiawei, a student passionate about programming and software development. Through these practicals, I am learning how to write cleaner, more maintainable code and apply best practices.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- Writing meaningful and descriptive variable and function names improves code readability.
- Keeping functions short and focused on a single task helps improve maintainability and testability.
- Consistent formatting and indentation makes code easier to understand and debug.

## Useful Links
- Correct linking of the programming mode pages and the CP1404 practical instructions library (https://github.com/WuJiawei25/CP1404)
