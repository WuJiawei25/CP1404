# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I also need to learn more about this topic, instead of writing code according to the examples, and gradually try not to look at the examples.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

When I complete a task, I always procrastinate until right before the deadline to complete the assignment, which leads to a lack of understanding and unsatisfactory completion of the assignment. Next time, I will actively complete the assignment and spend more time conceiving and completing the assignment.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am better at actively practicing and reviewing class material.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to spend more time to conceive and complete the assignment. Although I have basically completed the assignment code, I still need to study hard.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I hope to learn more case studies to better understand the application of programming in real life.
